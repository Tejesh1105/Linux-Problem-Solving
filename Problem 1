Scenario

A production Linux server suddenly starts responding slowly. Users report delays, but the server is still reachable via SSH.

Task

1.) Which Linux commands would you run first to identify whether the issue is related to CPU, memory, or disk?

2.) Briefly explain what you look for in the output of each command.

Answer - 
i) CPU check using top or mpstat
What i will check
 %us / %sys - high value means high CPU usage.
 %id - very low idle time means CPU saturation.
 Load average(1,5,15) to cpu cores.
In top, identify the process consuming high CPU.

ii) Memory check using free -h
What I check:
Available memory (not just free)
High usage of swap (indicates memory pressure)
If swap is actively being used == performance issue

iii) Disk Usage using df -h
What I check:
Any filesystem > 80–90% full
Root (/) or /var full → can cause services to fail

iv) Disk I/O (Very Important in Real Life) using iostat -x or top (checking %wa i.e I/O wait)command.
What I check:
High %wa → disk bottleneck
High await or %util → slow disks
