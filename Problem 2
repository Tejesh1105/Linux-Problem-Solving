Question 2 (Intermediate)
Scenario
A Linux server is running a critical application. Users complain that the application randomly becomes unresponsive, but CPU and memory usage look normal.
Task
How would you check if the issue is related to network connectivity or port availability?
List the exact commands you would use and what you’d look for in their output.


Solution:- 

1️) Check Basic Network Connectivity
ping -c 4 <server_ip>
What I look for:
Packet loss → network issue
High latency → unstable or congested network

2️) Trace Network Path & Latency
traceroute <server_ip>
or (better)
mtr <server_ip>
What I look for:
High latency or packet loss at specific hops
Timeouts indicating routing or firewall issues

3️) Check If Application Port Is Listening
ss -lntp | grep 8080
(or netstat -lntp on older systems)
What I look for:
Is the application actually listening on the expected port?
Which process owns the port?

4️) Check Active Connections
ss -ant | grep 8080
What I look for:
Large number of SYN_RECV or CLOSE_WAIT
Indicates network issues or app not closing connections properly

5️) Verify Service Status
systemctl status <service_name>

What I look for:
Frequent restarts
Service running but not responding

6️) Firewall Check (Often Missed by Freshers)
iptables -L -n
or
firewall-cmd --list-all

What I look for:
Port blocked or dropped packets
